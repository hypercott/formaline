# formaline
Formaline lets you include your source code in your executable or HDF5 output file.

Formaline is an idea by Erik Schnetter, https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/eschnetter/, who
first implemented it for the Cactus Computational Toolkit / the Einstein Toolkit (https://cactuscode.org, https://einsteintoolkit.org).

This repository contains a number of example implementations of formaline by Christian Ott.
